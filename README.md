# PRIORITY
    Priority determines which player can act at any given time (e.g. to play a loot card or activate an ability). While a player has priority, they can take as many (or as few!) actions as they want before passing priority to the next player. When each player passes priority in succession (i.e. no one wants to do anything else), the game progresses: the top loot, ability, or roll on the stack resolves (its effect is carried out), or the game moves to the next step or phase.

    Remember that most of the time it is not necessary to religiously keep track of the priority!
